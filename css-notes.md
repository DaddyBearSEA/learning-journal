 Anatomy of CSS

• Rule - CSS have rules and inheritance within the code. 

Selector  - el4ement, universl, class (begins with periods), id (begins with a #)


p {
    
    color: black
}

	• Rule - Last Rule - So if you use two <p> rules, it will use the second as that 

	• Inheritance - When creating style in the <boby> the child elements will inherit the style





- Selector 
	Emmet Syntax allows you to put a few letters in and you get the syntax.  There is so much more to explore.  

#### Property & value
- Property - Color is the property
- Value - Black is the Value

Declaration - property value pair


Curly braces - used to created the code for the CSS and is also used in JS

## Class and ID Attributes
Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.
